## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by and owes much to [quiver](https://github.com/varkor/quiver), a modern graphical editor for commutative diagrams created by [varkor](https://github.com/varkor). 

We gratefully acknowledge the original design, file format, and user experience that made this reimplementation possible.
